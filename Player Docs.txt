I'm making this game that I've loved for years, I'll get around to putting in all the features.

*Commands*
o - open
c - close
T - tunnel
i - inventory (removed this in favor of just having it onscreen all the time)
w - wield an item
t - remove (take off) a piece of equipment
< - go upstairs
> - go downstairs
d - drop
. - rest one turn
R - rest indefinitely (not fully implemented)
q - quaff a potion
n - set character name
^c - exit game

*Items*
Players will automatically pick up items they walk over. Inventory is sorted by item type.
Wielded items are added to the player's equipment.
Removed items are added to the player's inventory.
Someday, Lady Teldra will be a sword in this game. You can count on it.

*Monsters*
Monsters are balanced using several pieces of background literature. 
If this is your stuff, and you want me to change the thing, let me know.
AD&D Monster Manual, 4th printing 1979. 
Fiend Folio and Monster Manual 2. There will probably be some Harry Potter bits, 
I'll try to remember to keep this list up to date.
Steven Brust, you are *so* getting some air time on this game. If you ever read this, sir; Thank you very, very much. 

The Emperor Lich was really, Really, tough. The badder Faerie Dragons (Purple and up)
were scary but fun. They gave a lot of loot. There were resists to Fire, Cold, Lightning, and Acid, 
but none for Poison. This meant really tough creatures who could breathe poison were Very Dangerous.
If I saw an Ancient Green, I teleported off the level. No way I'm even heading for the stairs.

But, tourists hiking through, taking photos of things. They're peaceful, although sometimes the flashbulbs blind you.
Normally, you would have to answer a "Are you sure?" before being able to attack a peaceful creature. 
The tourist becomes angry! - more -
The tourist calls 911! - more -
<Three Elven Mages with a couple of pet jhereg teleport in> 
Uh, oh. 

That could ruin your whole day.

But, if you had a unique sword, one with a personality and a relationship with you, along with its own innate abilities, 
it might just keep your word for you anyway.
You are trying to attack the peaceful tourist. - more - 
Are you sure? [y/N] (yes)
Lady Teldra refuses to leave her sheath. - more - 
_Now *really*, Bait. I expected better of you._ She'd never *say* it, of course. But you'd feel it anyway. 
Because, you know,  

Teldra.
