JMoria Work List
----------------
DATA / GAMEPLAY:
- implement DAT file reading (XML format? INI format? passwd format?) for: dungeon, item, savefile
- Now that monsters.txt can be read, create many new monster defs.
- once this is done, clean up the hardcoded monster creation in Dungeon.cpp


COMBAT:
- AI maybe? The monsters are being read in, and just need to get monsters spawning into the dungeon again. Some kind of 
  random picking from the monster list, starting the AIbrains going, seeing if I can watch them wander around...
- combat is very hardcoded. make it not so much.
- implement monster fighting back (might need HP and stuff for that, though)


ARCHITECTURE:
- figure out who owns the set of monsterdefs and dungeontiledefs (is dungeon good enough?)
- load texture only once (see flipcode "Hey! It works!" article re: managers) -- 1.27.06 downloaded to E:\Work\FAQ
- someone (who?) needs to own an "ASCIItoIndex()" functon that takes a char and returns char - ' ' - 1
- each dungeon thing {monster, player, dungeontile} should store its tex coords and tile (write at create and onchange); 
  saves a % and / per obj, per frame. costs 1 vector/obj.
- continue to implement CDungeon (current level, CMonster List, CItem List)


FONT / TEXTURE / DISPLAY / COLOR:
- displaytext: figure out how to make background the color you want.
  decide on some decent colors for bounding box, inverse, and regular text.
- game crashes if you pass in a string that needs to break on whitespace but has a word that's too long.
- make tileset complain if the damned image isn't the right shape/size.
- make the font bitmap load only once. (perhaps tileset can handle this? by returning the handle, size, etc of the
  already loaded bitmap?) (what if I want different fonts?)
  (perhaps a tilemgr? maybe just all the DisplayText boxes use the same (set of) fonts?
  foo=new DisplayText(FONT_COURIER, JRect()) maybe)


ENGINE / RENDERING:
- Keep the renderer you have for awhile. Concentrate on putting together a solid gameplay demo.
- Contract art later as needed.
- The CRender class is ready to be renamed to C3DRender,
  with base-class stuff ripped out and put into CRenderBase.
  Once that's done, C2DRender needs to be built up into an SDL-only blitting renderer.
  Once the SDL renderer is running on Win32, move the new code over to PS2 and try it.
- Eventually, will probably want to build a real PS2 renderer.
- (Update 12.3.2017) ported to OSX, which required switching to SDL2. Other than rewriting CRender::initSDL(), no major changes. However, at this point, the key bindings are messed up; I think once that's complete, we will be back to wherever we were when we last left the project (in 2006?). As an aside, I also moved the code from VSS to Github git@github.com:Rushwind13/JMoria.git as part of this work.'


STABILITY:
- be able to close the game properly.
- figure out why the game is so rickety?
- figure out why the framerate seems to tank? unfreed resources? (4/10/03 still a problem? Haven't seen it)


DUNGEON GENERATION: (as of 1.27.06, hardcoded 16x16 dungeon back in)
- 1.27.06: hardcoded 16x16 dungeon back in. Get to work on gameplay. SDL crash was in Dungeon->Draw(), where 
  I had hardcoded 256x256 instead of DUNG_WIDTH/HEIGHT. duh.
- 1.1.05: tried to clean up a little and put the game in a state where it could be worked on. This met little success. 
  I attempted to put back in the hardcoded 16x16 dungeon (dungeonmap.cpp/dungeonconstants,h),
  but got an SDL crash at some point. Should probably look this up. If dungeon creation could be put on the back burner 
  for awhile, it would be nice to work on something else;
- The random dungeon generation is a little broken. I think this is because of weird recursion behavior.
  It would be a lot easier to test if the generation happened visually. Try to make this happen.
- Tried to add NewLevelState to help with stepping through dungeon generation. Add back to project at some point.
- Also, make sure that there are enough rooms generated every time. Sometimes, it just tails out 
  after 1 or 2 rooms.
