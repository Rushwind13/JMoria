JMoria Work List
----------------
DATA / GAMEPLAY:
- implement DAT file reading (XML format? INI format? passwd format?) for: dungeon, races, classes, spells, savefile
- need to add status effects (e.g. poison)
- implement "flavored" attacks, e.g. a _BREATHE type should read m_dwFlags to figure out which type of breath (fire, ice, &c)s

DOORS / TRAPS / SCENERY:
- make new DUNG_IDX types for locked, secret, and broken doors (are these just DUNG_FLAG? need different icon for secret)
- make new DUNG_IDX types for secret and visible traps (DUNG_FLAG? still need a different icon... ish.) Seems like m_dtd changes secret->visible when seen, changes again visible->floor when disarmed...
- make new DUNG_IDX type for gold vein
- rubble has chance of treasure

MONSTERS:
- orcs
- trolls
- giants
- Ettin
- floating eye
- Ogre
- goblin- goblin shaman
- goblin warrior
- goblin chieftain
- uruk-hai
- skeletons / zombies / ghosts / ghoul / wight / vampire / lich
- novice paladin / ranger / priest / warrior /
- hobbit (steals your purse and runs away)
- mind flayer
- dzur / tiassa / hawk
- Tiamat
- You must defeat 17 Warriors from the Hall of Heroes in combat, before you may face Tiamat.


ITEMS:
- Magic items "x of Protection", "y of Resist Fire", but scramble the varieties each game of course.
- ego items [FB] [DB] [WB] [DF] [HA] ...
- unique items I mean Vlad had to take on a Jenoine, I'm just saying.
- Maybe uniques can't be found until the character holding them dies.
- pickaxe / shovel
- monsters can carry treasure


PLAYER:
- Player can only hold one of each wieldable type (for now; two rings is an enhancement)
- equipped items enhance player instrinsics; player wears ring, set the intrinsic "isInvisible" on the player.
- equipped items are used to make attacks and to defend against attacks (raise AC, raise to-hit and damage stats, &c)
- equippable items restricted to certain subset of all items ITEM_FLAG_EQUIPMENT, instead of hardcoded in CPlayer::Wield.
- implement paginated inventory


COMBAT:
- combat is very hardcoded. make it not so much.
- should monsters be able to wield items? use potions? pick stuff up off the ground?
- need to add speed, somehow
- add "seek" AI (monster tries to move towards player)



ARCHITECTURE:
- figure out who owns the set of monsterdefs and dungeontiledefs (is dungeon good enough?)
- load texture only once (see flipcode "Hey! It works!" article re: managers) -- 1.27.06 downloaded to E:\Work\FAQ
- Util:: needs to own an "ASCIItoIndex()" functon that takes a char and returns char - ' ' - 1 (need a lookup table from MON_IDX_* to monster tile { MON_IDX_DRAGON: 'd' })
- each dungeon thing {monster, player, dungeontile} should store its tex coords and tile (write at create and onchange); 
  saves a % and / per obj, per frame. costs 1 vector/obj.
- continue to implement CDungeon (current level, CMonster List, CItem List)
- some way to implement unit tests would be nice.
- Which routines should be owned by Dungeon? Which by Player? Monster? Item?
- Need Architecture diagram
- Need Developer's Guide



FONT / TEXTURE / DISPLAY / COLOR:
- displaytext: figure out how to make background the color you want.
  decide on some decent colors for bounding box, inverse, and regular text.
- game crashes if you pass in a string that needs to break on whitespace but has a word that's too long.
- make tileset complain if the damned image isn't the right shape/size.
- make the font bitmap load only once. (perhaps tileset can handle this? by returning the handle, size, etc of the
  already loaded bitmap?) (what if I want different fonts?)
  (perhaps a tilemgr? maybe just all the DisplayText boxes use the same (set of) fonts?
  foo=new DisplayText(FONT_COURIER, JRect()) maybe)
- display player intrinsics as part of the texture coloration: stripes for each one, or "LEDs" or something.
- create new PNGs for different sized fonts (the mipmapping for text output looks dumb)




ENGINE / RENDERING:
- Keep the renderer you have for awhile. Concentrate on putting together a solid gameplay demo.
- Contract art later as needed.
- The CRender class is ready to be renamed to C3DRender,
  with base-class stuff ripped out and put into CRenderBase.
  Once that's done, C2DRender needs to be built up into an SDL-only blitting renderer.
  Once the SDL renderer is running on Win32, move the new code over to PS2 and try it.
- Eventually, will probably want to build a real PS2 renderer.
- (Update 12.3.2017) ported to OSX, which required switching to SDL2. Other than rewriting CRender::initSDL(), no major changes. we will are back to where we were when we last left the project (in 2006?). I also moved the code from VSS to Github git@github.com:Rushwind13/JMoria.git .



STABILITY:
- be able to close the game properly.
- figure out why the game is so rickety?
- figure out why the framerate seems to tank? unfreed resources? (4/10/03 still a problem? Haven't seen it)
- 12.5.2017 - B reports occasionally all the text goes black on black, doesn't affect the dungeon, only the overlay.
- 12.5.2017 - getting a lot of intermittent "bad string" complaints; wtf?! like for some reason the string lookup table sometimes isn't working right
- 12.14.2017 - Just saw Star Wars 8 tonight, woot. Also, JMoria beats the heck out of the CPU, I left it running, and it was using 90%+ CPU, caused the fan to come on... maybe if it was locked to a particular framerate (like 30fps), it would give the CPU more of a break in between cycles?



DUNGEON GENERATION: (as of 1.27.06, hardcoded 16x16 dungeon back in)
- 12.5.2017: in lieu of full dungeon generation, maybe have a small set of hardcoded dungeons (like the 16x16 but rotated), choose among them. Beginnings of "room type"
- 1.27.06: hardcoded 16x16 dungeon back in. Get to work on gameplay. SDL crash was in Dungeon->Draw(), where 
  I had hardcoded 256x256 instead of DUNG_WIDTH/HEIGHT. duh.
- 1.1.05: tried to clean up a little and put the game in a state where it could be worked on. This met little success. 
  I attempted to put back in the hardcoded 16x16 dungeon (dungeonmap.cpp/dungeonconstants,h),
  but got an SDL crash at some point. Should probably look this up. If dungeon creation could be put on the back burner 
  for awhile, it would be nice to work on something else;
- The random dungeon generation is a little broken. I think this is because of weird recursion behavior.
  It would be a lot easier to test if the generation happened visually. Try to make this happen.
- Tried to add NewLevelState to help with stepping through dungeon generation. Add back to project at some point.
- Also, make sure that there are enough rooms generated every time. Sometimes, it just tails out 
  after 1 or 2 rooms.
